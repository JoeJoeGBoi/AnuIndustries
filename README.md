## Apple Music downloader example

The `scripts/download_apple_music.py` module shows how to use the
[`gamdl`](https://github.com/skeithryan/gamdl) library to download Apple
Music content. To run the example you need to install `gamdl` and provide
an authenticated Netscape-format `cookies.txt` file.

```bash
pip install gamdl
python scripts/download_apple_music.py
```
